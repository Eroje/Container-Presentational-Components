# Container-Presentational-Components
+ I divided a complex React component into a container component and a couple of presentational components.
+ STEPS:
+ Identified that the original component needed to be refactored: it handled calculations/logic and presentation/rendering.
+ Created a container component containing all the stateful logic.
+ Created a function that calls the state setter method provided by useState().
+ Created and exported presentational components containing only JSX.
+ Imported the presentational components into the container component.
+ Used the presentational components in the return statement of the container component.
+ Passed state and functions used to change state as props to the rendered presentational components.
